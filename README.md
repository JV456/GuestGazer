## üìã Project Overview

This project implements an end-to-end MLOps pipeline for predicting hotel reservation cancellations. The system helps hotels optimize their operations through accurate cancellation predictions using machine learning and modern deployment practices.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Hotels face significant revenue losses due to last-minute cancellations. This project addresses this challenge by building a robust prediction system that enables hotels to:
- Implement dynamic pricing strategies
- Optimize room allocation
- Enhance customer retention through targeted offers

## üè® Use Cases

### 1. Revenue Management
- **Overbooking Strategy**: Predict cancellations to safely overbook rooms and maximize occupancy
- **Dynamic Pricing**: Adjust room rates based on cancellation likelihood
- **Revenue Optimization**: Minimize losses from no-shows and cancellations

### 2. Targeted Marketing
- **Personalized Offers**: Provide attractive deals to customers likely to cancel
- **Retention Campaigns**: Implement proactive customer retention strategies
- **Customer Engagement**: Enhance customer experience through personalized services

### 3. Fraud Detection
- **Pattern Recognition**: Identify customers with frequent cancellation patterns
- **Risk Assessment**: Flag potentially fraudulent booking behaviors
- **Preventive Measures**: Implement booking restrictions for high-risk customers
